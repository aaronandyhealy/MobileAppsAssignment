# WeatherApp
This uwp app allows you to get the weather conditions for your current location.
The app works using the openweathermap.org/api to get the weather conditions.

## Functionality
The app works by using the users device geolocation to get the current latitude and longitude. These are then passed into the openweather api to recieve the current weather conditions. These are saved as variables and outputted to the user.

## Technologies Used
- Git
- XAML
- C#

## Improvements
I was unable to get the 5 day weather forecast to work correctly so that would be a future improvement.
I would also like to add a search function to allow the user to search for different locations.
